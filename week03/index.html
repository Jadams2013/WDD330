	<h1>WDD 330 portfolio</h1>
	<h2>Week 03</h2>
	<h3>Reading notes:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><a href=https://javascript.info/object-methods>refresh</a> on <code>this</code> keyword</li>
		<li>Javascript novice to ninja chapters 5-7 
		<ul>
			<li>I was confused about objects vs object literals so I did some outside research to find the answer. If I understand correctly now, literal just means hard coded in the program rather than created at runtime. Is this correct?</li> 
			<li>reviewed dot notation vs bracket notation. <code>object.property</code> vs <code>object['property']</code></li> 
			<li>in operator: checks if an object has a property.</li>
			<li>review of JSON, Math, Date, RegExp, </li>
			<li>review of the DOM. This was easier as I remembered more from past classes on this subject.</li>
			<li>review of Events. I also remembered more from past classes on this subject.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Weekly team meeting
		<ul>
			<li>Misunderstanding this week: I still thought we would get incorporated into another group, and didn't notice you saying we should stay just the two of us until Saturday.</li> 
			<li>Going to meet on Thursdays at 2pm going forward</li> 
			<li>Did it myself this week because of misunderstanding</li> 
			<li>learned: refresher about <code>===</code> vs <code>==</code> operators and typing</li> 
			<li><a href=arrayCardioSolution.html>Teacher's solution</a></li>
