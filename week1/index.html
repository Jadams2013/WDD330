	<h2>Week 01</h2>

		<li></li>
		<li><a href="story_editor.html">Code sample from doing_stuff_with_web_things</a></li>
		<li>Having trouble with getting the javascript to cooperate, but I finally understand where I should be starting from.</li> 
		<li>I need to make sure I have access to the reading materials. the instructions made it seem like the textbook listed in ilearn would be the only thing I would need from sitepoint, but that seems to not be the case. </li>
		<li>I need to figure out if its worth the fuss and cost of getting a sitepoint subscription or if I can plan to just use free suplemental material from the internet generally to study the same topics as we go through the semester</li>
		<li>its also really annoying the way that chrome caches pages. I need to figure out how to turn that off or I know I'll end up pulling my hair out as soon as things star to get complex.</li>
